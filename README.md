> A very simple tic-tac-toe website written in HTML, CSS, and JS.

This was part of the [JS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev) that I took.

The tic tac toe algorithm isn't perfect, but it can at least draw every single game (on hard difficulty).
